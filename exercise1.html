                        <p>
                            I tried using p5.js to do a 3D simulation.
                            Recently, I've been interested in Perlin noise and I was pleasantly surprised that the p5.js
                            API has a noise() function.
                            I used it to make a bundle of cubes that responds to the mouse.
                            You can hover over the cubes to unleash an EDM concert right in your browser.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How It Works</h2>
                        <p>
                            Using p5's WebGL canvas, I draw five cubes to the screen using a for loop.
                            I rotate the cubes along the x and y axis each frame.
                            I introduce noise to the rotation and size of each cube to add a bit of chaos.
                            The intensity of the noise increases as the mouse moves further away from the center of the
                            screen and decreases as the mouse moves closer.
                            This basically has the effect of destabilizing the cubes as you move the mouse away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hovering over the cubes opens up a hallway of shapes.
                            The size of the shapes increases exponentially to create the illusion of zooming through
                            a hallway.
                            To draw each shape in even intervals, I divide the frame rate by the number of shapes and
                            iterate over this interval.
                            To further multiply the shapes, I nest a for loop to clone each shape.
                            I use the random() function to achieve the glitchy flickering effect.
