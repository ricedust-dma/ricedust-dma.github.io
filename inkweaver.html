                        <p>
                            <i>Inkweaver</i> is a generative art tool for creating spontaneous line art.
                            By adjusting the brush properties, you can create anything from methodical,
                            textured doodles to freeflowing, sporadic lineography. You can find examples <a href="project1.html#gallery">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h2>How It Works</h2>
                        <p>
                            Lines are drawn by particles that leave a trail as they move across the screen.
                            As the mouse is dragged, more particles are added to the canvas.
                            Each particle has a position, velocity, and acceleration.
                            In order to push particles around, the canvas applies a force to the particle.
                            The angle of this force is determined by the coordinate of the particle mapped to 2D Perlin
                            noise.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>
                            I think I was able to achieve a pretty distinctive visual style with <i>Inkweaver</i>, and
                            I'm very happy with the possibilities that the different line settings offer.
                            In Art 74, I wrote a drawing program called <i>Lineweaver</i> that explores the beauty of order and symmetry.
                            In contrast, <i>Inkweaver</i> embraces the unpredictable, organic forms that arise from chaos and chance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I thought about adding colors to the lines and shifting the hue depending on time, position, or noise.
                            In the end, I chose grayscale to maintain simplicity and draw more attention to form and texture.
                            That said, I think that color could add a limitless number of exciting aesthetic possibilities with some more time and thought.

                        <h2>How to Use</h2>
                        <p>
                            Use the mouse to draw on the canvas. Create up to 27 unique brushes by combining
                            multiple line settings.
